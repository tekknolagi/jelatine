 Jelatine installation instructions
 ==================================

 Jelatine needs a C99-compliant compiler, the classpath needs Sun's javac
compiler shipped with Sun's JDK (versions 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 should work starting
from version 0.8.7) or the Eclipse java compiler (ECJ) which is supported since
version 0.8.8. The latest version of the JDK can be found here
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp . The Jikes compiler is not
yet supported unfortunately.

 If you want JAR file support then the zziplib
library will be needed at build time as well as a 'jar' tool (both Sun's jar and
fastjar work). You can find zziplib sources here: http://zziplib.sourceforge.net
or install it with the package manager shipping with your favourite
distribution. For example for Debian-based distributions (Ubuntu, etc...):

aptitude install libzzip-dev

For Fedora:

yum install zziplib-devel

 In order to build Jelatine just unpack the archive, cd in
its directory then launch the configure script, build an install, eg:

$ tar xvzf jelatine-0.9.4.tar.gz
$ cd jelatine-0.9.4
$ ./configure --prefix=/home/myname/temp
$ make
$ make install

The configure script accepts the following extra options:

--disable-preverifier

Do not build the preverifier, this is automatically enabled if cross-compiling,
in that case it is imperative to have a preverifier already build for the host
and visible in the default PATH.

--disable-jar

Disables JAR support. JAR support is enabled automatically if the zziplib
library is available.

--disable-socket

Disables network socket support. Socket support is automatically enabled if the
relevant header files are present on the target.

--disable-threaded

Disables the threaded version of the interpreter, by default the threaded
interpreter is enabled if the compiler provides the proper extension
(namely gcc's labels-as-values extension).

--disable-finalizer

Disables object finalization support. Object finalization requires thread
support, when thread support is disabled finalization will also be disabled
automatically.

--disable-fp-support

Disables floating-point support in the VM making it closer to the CLDC 1.0
specification. By default the VM tries to conform to the CLDC 1.1 specification.

  --disable-prgc

Disables the pointer reversal algorythm in the garbage collector, used mainly
for testing purposes.

--enable-debug

Enables extra-debug information, may be broken, use with care

--enable-tracing

Enables tracing of opcodes and methods, whilst this option is already available
no tracing facilites have been implemented yet.

--enable-printing

Enable printing facilities (methods/opcodes) which are currently fairly crude

--with-thread-model=<model>

Selects the thread model used by the VM: pthread for POSIX thread, pth for
GNU/Pth and none if thread support must be disabled.

 The intallation process will install the default classpath classes into
prefix/share/jelatine. If no path is passed to the --bootclasspath command-line
switch then the VM will look there by default.

 The boot classpath (containing the standard classes) may be provided by using
the -b (or --bootclasspath) option, the default classpath used for looking
user-provided classes is the current directory and may be adjusted by using the
-c (or --classpath) option. Here's an example assuming that you built and
installed jelatine and wish to run the HelloWorld class just type:

$ jelatine HelloWorld

 If you have unpacked and built Jelatine in your home directory but you didn't
install it you could run it this way:

/home/myself/jelatine-0.9.4/src/jelatine/jelatine --bootclasspath /home/myself/jelatine-0.9.4/src/classpath HelloWorld

 The CLDC specification requires Java classes to be preprocessed using a
preverification tool provided by Sun's reference CLDC implementation. In order
to make your classes comply with the CLDC standard you have to either use the
tool shipped with jelatine (preverifier) or the appropriate flags of Sun's
javac compiler. On top of this you have to specify Jelatine's classpath as the
compiler bootclasspath otherwise it will use J2SE classes instead of the J2ME
ones.

For example let's say that you have an HelloWorld.java source file and you wish
to compile it for use with jelatine. The procedure - assuming that you have
installed jelatine with the default /usr/local prefix and that both jelatine and
the preverifier are in your PATH - is the following:

$ javac -bootclasspath /usr/local/share/jelatine/classpath.jar HelloWorld.java
$ preverifier HelloWorld

Then you may run your application with

$ jelatine HelloWorld

The javac compiler from Sun shipped with version 1.5 also provides the
'-target cldc1.0' flag which does the same work as the preverifier so you can
use it instead of the included preverifier.

If you still have trouble using your application with jelatine feel free to
contact me at gabriele.svelto@gmail.com, possibly including your code if you
think you may have found a bug in Jelatine.

Basic Installation
==================

Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package.  The following
more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
instructions specific to this package.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
debugging `configure').

   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
cache files.

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
     some messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

  6. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
     files again.

Compilers and Options
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
`configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help' for
details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix

   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
reconfiguring for another architecture.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out automatically,
but needs to determine by the type of machine the package will run on.
Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the _same_
architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:

     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:

     OS KERNEL-OS

   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the machine type.

   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
produce code for.

   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.

Sharing Defaults
================

If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share, you
can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default
values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Defining Variables
==================

Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:

     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc

causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
overridden in the site shell script).

Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to
an Autoconf bug.  Until the bug is fixed you can use this workaround:

     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash

`configure' Invocation
======================

`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
     disable caching.

`--config-cache'
`-C'
     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.

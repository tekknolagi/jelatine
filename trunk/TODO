*** TBD for Jelatine future releases:

 - Add support for profiling and tracing method and bytecode execution
   (partially done)
 - An example profile should be written (for example the MIDP one) to provide
   a reference implementation and the possibility of running code using more
   classes than the pure CLDC classpath
 - The bytecode verification process should be implemented properly
 - Possibly remove the dependency on zziplib for JAR support or find a way to
   make zziplib allocate its memory on Jelatine's unified heap
 - Pointer compression should be added, this should allow us to store Java
   references in 16-bit pointers for heaps of up to 256 KiB
 - Implement object relocation and heap compaction
 - The preverifier breaks under heavy optimizations and 64-bit targets, it
   should be rewritten
 - Make native method descriptors more compact
 - Rework the classpath build system, make it faster and more robust with
   different javac & preverifier combinations
 - Add support for modified UTF-8 surrogate characters
 - Streamline the system-dependent part of the multi-threading implementation
